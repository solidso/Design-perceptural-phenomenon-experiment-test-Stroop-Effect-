# Design-perceptural-phenomenon-experiment-test-Stroop-Effect-
In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect.
I will learn more about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. Besides, I will look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and compute some statistics describing the results. 

Some task will be completed in this project, 
- 1 how to identify components of an experiment. 
- 2 How to use descriptive statistics to describe investgate qualities of a sample
- 3 How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
